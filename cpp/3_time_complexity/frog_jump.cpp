/*
A small frog wants to get to the other side of the road. The frog is currently located at position X and wants to get to a position greater than or equal to Y. The small frog always jumps a fixed distance, D.

Count the minimal number of jumps that the small frog must perform to reach its target.

Write a function:

    int solution(int X, int Y, int D);

that, given three integers X, Y and D, returns the minimal number of jumps from position X to a position equal to or greater than Y.

For example, given:
  X = 10
  Y = 85
  D = 30

the function should return 3, because the frog will be positioned as follows:

        after the first jump, at position 10 + 30 = 40
        after the second jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 = 70
        after the third jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 + 30 = 100

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

        X, Y and D are integers within the range [1..1,000,000,000];
        X â‰¤ Y.

    return 0;

        return 0;
    }

    return static_cast<int>(ceil(static_cast<double>(to_cross) / static_cast<double>(D)));
